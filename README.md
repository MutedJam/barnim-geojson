## Data Source
[© OpenStreetMap contributors](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)

The data was extracted from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) using [OSM-Boundaries](https://osm-boundaries.com/) and is therefore available under the [Open Database License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/). It took me a while to get the hang of things and find a suitable data source, so I figured I'd share it on the off chance someone might need it in the future. It was originally used to visualize the 7-day incidence of COVID-19 infections on a more local level than the one provided by the official county source (but has been replaced with a table view since, feel free to take a look at https://covid19barnim.thomasmartens.eu/ if you are curious).
